# Segment the largest disks
The goal of this small project is to train a neural network that segments only a selected number of the largest disks in synthetically generated images, while recognizing the order from the largest to the smallest segment.

## Tasks to do
The project is under development.
- [ ] logging (especially confusion matrix metric),
- [ ] replace mock mse loss with dice loss and cross entropy,
- [ ] build docker image with CI pipeline for building the latest version
- [ ] experiment and explore various model architectures
